                            The Red Fort was built by none other than the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan to serve as the palace fort for his capital Shahjahanabad. He commissioned the construction of the fort by the River Yamuna when he decided to shift his capital to Delhi from Agra. The construction, which started in 1638, took over 8 years to complete. The structure was originally named Qila-i-Mubarak, which means ‘the Blessed Fort’. During its history of over three centuries, the fort saw many occupants, including Aurangzeb, Jahandar Shah, Muhammad Shah, and Bahadur Shah II, among others.
                            The Red Fort underwent massive destruction in 1739 when the Persian ruler Nadir Shan invaded the city and plundered the fort of many valuable artifacts, including the Peacock Throne. Later, during the 1857 Revolt against the British, the marble structures of the fort were also destroyed.

It was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as a memorial for his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. Constructed entirely out of white marble in the 17th century, Taj Mahal is one of the most beautiful monuments in the world. Every year visitors numbering more than the entire population of Agra pass through the magnificent gates to catch a glimpse of this breathtaking monument! 
                            The Taj Mahal was built as a mausoleum by Shah Jahan for his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died while giving birth to their 14th child in 1631. Her death left the emperor completely heartbroken, and his hair is said to have turned grey overnight. The construction of the Taj began in 1632. Th main building was completed in eight years, but the whole complex was not completed until 1653. Soon after the construction was completed, Shah Jahan was overthrown by his son Aurangzeb and imprisoned in the Agra Fort. For the rest of his life, he could only gaze at his wondrous creation through a window. Shah Jahan died in 1666, after which his mortal remains were buried here alongside Mumtaz. 
                            
                            Over 20,000 people from all over Indian and Central Asia worked on this striking building. Specialists were brought from as far away as Europe who produced the beautiful marble screens and marble inlay (pietra dura) which is made of thousands of semi precious stones. Taj Mahal was designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983. It looks as pristine today as it was first constructed. The monument underwent a massive restoration project in the early 20th century.

It is a beguiling, 5-storied building dating back to the 18th century, which, with its lacy grillworks and honey-comb facade, renders city dwellers and travellers an extraordinary visual spectacle. From its intricate decors to the panoramas visible from here, Hawa Mahal is a popular landmark that demands a visit at least one in life. The alluring Hawa Mahal night view - when the moonlight shines on the city, is an experience in itself that leaves visitors awestruck.
                            The history of Hawa Mahal, the palace of winds, is quite intriguing. It was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh for the court harem so that they could witness the royal processions and the street life. The exquisite pink and red sandstone ‘mahal’ stand out for its striking architecture, and the beautiful ‘jhaali’ works on its 953 windows.

                            data-description="The Gateway of India was constructed in 1911 to honor the visit and the landing of Queen Mary and King George V at Apollo Bundar. The grand arch monument was designed by a Scottish architect named George Wittet while Sir George Clarke, who was serving as the Governor of Bombay during those times, laid the foundation stone in 1913. Construction of the monument began in 1915, which continued for almost 10 years. On 4th December 1924, the monument was inaugurated by Rufus Isaacs, who was the then Viceroy of India.
                            After the Gateway was constructed, it served as the ceremonial entry point to India for Viceroys, new governors of Bombay Presidency, and other high-ranking officials. On 25th August 2003, a bomb blast occurred near the Gateway that left bloody trails in front of the monument. The structure, however, didn’t suffer any damage.

This grand and exquisite memorial not only stands as reminiscence to the rule of British Crown in the Indian subcontinent but also stands out as an excellent architectural gem in Indo-Saracenic revivalist style.

                            data-description="Akbar was the third Mughal emperor and undoubtedly the greatest. He was crowned the Mughal ruler in 1556 at the tender age of 14, when his father Humayun died suddenly. After Akbar consolidated his rule, he began constructing the Agra Fort, which coincided with the building of Humayun's tomb in Delhi. Akbar began the construction of this massive fort made of red sandstone on the banks of the Yamuna in 1565. The fort was ready by 1571, though additions were made up until the rule of Shahjahan, who was Akbar's grandson. During the time of Akbar, the fort mainly served military purpose, while by the time of Shahjahan it also served as a palace and court.
                            The fort's colossal double walls rise 20 m in height and measure 2.5 km in circumference. The fort is surrounded by a moat. The lofty battlements of the Agra fort cast its protective shadow over the far stretching mansions of nobles and princes built along the riverfront. The magnificent towers, bastions and ramparts and majestic gateways symbolized the confidence and power of the third Mughal emperor. The fort contains splendid palaces both in red sandstone and white marble built by two generations of prolific builders, Akbar and later on by Jahangir and Shahjahan. Of the nearly 500 Akbari buildings built in the Bengal and Gujarati traditions, only a few have survived, arrayed in a band on the riverfront.

                            data-description="Built by local Maurya rulers (often confused with imperial Maurya Rulers) in 7th century A.D, the Chittorgarh Fort in Rajasthan is one of the largest forts in India. The Chittorgarh Fort, plainly known as Chittor is spread majestically over a hill of 590 feet in height and is spread across 692 acres of land is a fine example of the popular Rajput architecture. The imposing structure of the fort has many gateways built by the later rulers of the Maurya clan. Chittorgarh Fort was previously the capital of Mewar and is now situated in the city of Chittorgarh. Chittorgarh Fort reverberates with tales of heroism and sacrifice and displays the Rajput culture and values in the real sense. Owing to its magnificent edifice, the Chittorgarh Fort was declared a UNESCO's World Heritage Site in the year 2013.
                            There is a long road of 1 km that leads to the Chittorgarh Fort and is quite steep. It is often considered to be the pride of the state as there are many historical sacrifices related to it. Chittorgarh Fort is also called the Water Fort as it had 84 water bodies once, but now there are only 22 of them left. The two major attractions of the fort are the towers Vijay Stambh and Kirti Stambh. Vijay Stambh refers to the tower of victory and the Kirti Stambh means tower of fame. The towers are illuminated in the evening and it looks even more beautiful. Apart from the towers, there are many palaces and temples within the premises of the fort, most notable being Meera Temple.
